# Text Analysis Workflow
This workflow is able to count the number of occurance of each word in a Harry Potter book

##Usages:

wc.py:
The wc.py script will parse the file "hp.txt" (Harry Potter book), count the number of occurance of each word, then output the statistic summary in the "wc.txt"

sort.py:
The sort.py script will take "wc.txt" as input and sort the word by count in descending order, then save the output in a filed called "wc-sorted.txt"

plot.py:
The plot.py script will plot a graph with the frequency of the top 25 most used words.
